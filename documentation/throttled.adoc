== Throttled

So far throttling has mostly been performed by EJB pooling.
@Throttling allows the limitation of service calls per timeframe.

[source, java]
----
@Throttling(permits=50, timeUnit=TimeUnit.SECONDS)
public class Foo {
  
  @Throttled(tryTimeOut=2, timeUnit=TimeUnit.SECONDS)
  public void throttledMethod() {
    ...
  }
}
----

During a timeframe the permits are decreased on each invocation. When the permits reach 0 and the 
requesting threads try timeout is reached (default=0) a ThrottlingException is thrown. 

The permits are replenished to the maximum specified at the end of the given timeframe.
