== Locked

@Locked provides EJB Singleton style concurrent access control to CDI managed beans.   
To control access to a beans type the @Locked annotation has to be applied to the type.
[source, java]
----
@Locked
public void Foo {
 ...
}
----
By default the LockType.WRITE is applied to all business methods, this can be overriden at
type and method level by defining the required LockType.
[source, java]
----
//Defines READ lock to all business methods.
@Locked(LockType.READ)
public void Foo {
  ...
  //Overrides type LockType for businessMethod()
  @Locked(LockType.WRITE)
  public void writeMethod() {}
}
----

LockType.WRITE requires exclusive access to the managed beans instance.

Example usage:
[source, java]
----
@Locked
public void Foo {
  //requires exclusive lock.
  @Locked(Locked.WRITE)
  public void write(String bar) {
    ...
  }
  
  //allows concurrent access, unless write lock is held.
  @Locked(Locked.READ)
  public String read() {
    ...
  }
}
----

The lock employees approxmiate arrival-order policy by utilising ReentrantReadWriteLock with farineess parameter. 

[quote, Java 7 ReentrantReadWriteLock]
----
When the currently held lock is released either the longest-waiting single writer thread will be assigned the write lock, or if there is a group of reader threads waiting longer than all waiting writer threads, that group will be assigned the read lock.
A thread that tries to acquire a fair read lock (non-reentrantly) will block if either the write lock is held, or there is a waiting writer thread. The thread will not acquire the read lock until after the oldest currently waiting writer thread has acquired and released the write lock. Of course, if a waiting writer abandons its wait, leaving one or more reader threads as the longest waiters in the queue with the write lock free, then those readers will be assigned the read lock.

A thread that tries to acquire a fair write lock (non-reentrantly) will block unless both the read lock and write lock are free (which implies there are no waiting threads). (Note that the non-blocking https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.html#tryLock()[``ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock.tryLock()``] and https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock.html#tryLock()[``ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock.tryLock()``] methods do not honor this fair setting and will acquire the lock if it is possible, regardless of waiting threads.)

=== Limitation

Conversation context is currently protected by the container, premempting '''@Locked interceptor rendering it useless.
